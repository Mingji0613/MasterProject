# Predicting the Identity and Abundance of Globally-Important Tyrosinase Genes in Bacteria

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for Mingji Zhang's Master's Program project at IC (Imperial College London). This project focuses on predicting the identity and abundance of globally-important Tyrosinase genes in bacteria using metagenomics and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
This project aims to understand the distribution and abundance of Tyrosinase genes in bacterial communities across different environments. By leveraging metagenomic data and advanced machine learning methods, the project seeks to uncover patterns and relationships between Tyrosinase genes and bacterial hosts. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into the ecological significance of these genes and their potential impact on various ecosystems.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:
- **ML**: Contains code related to machine learning models and algorithms.
- **Period**: Includes periodic progress reports and updates on the project's development.
- **data**: Holds the datasets and data processing scripts used in the project.
- **project_proposal**: Contains the initial project proposal and related documents.
- **visualization**: Includes scripts and code for data visualization and exploration.
- **write**: Contains the final report and documentation related to the project.
