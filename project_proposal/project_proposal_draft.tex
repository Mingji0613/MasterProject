\section{background}

The relationship between microbial nutrient preferences and gene sequences has long been a topic of interest in microbiology. Nutrient preference is a crucial factor for microbial growth, metabolism, and survival, and understanding these preferences can aid in the design of optimized microbial culture protocols. Traditional genomic analysis is commonly used to study microbial nutrient preferences, but its computational demands and limitations in data processing make it challenging to use in large-scale studies.\\

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, including machine learning and deep learning, have made it possible to overcome these limitations and improve the accuracy and efficiency of microbial nutrient preference analysis. By learning from large sets of genomic data, AI techniques can uncover patterns and differences in microbial metabolic pathways and nutrient usage, providing a better understanding of microbial nutrient preferences. Furthermore, models based on deep learning can predict the genomic sequences of microorganisms and their corresponding nutrient preferences.\\

However, there are several limitations associated with the use of AI techniques in microbial nutrient preference studies. As metabolic pathways and growth conditions are influenced by a variety of factors, it is essential to validate the accuracy and reliability of models through more experimental data. Additionally, the training of AI models requires a large amount of data and computational resources, which can be challenging for microbial species with limited data. Furthermore, the interpretability of AI models remains an issue, and the credibility and interpretation of model prediction results require further improvement. Finally, more comprehensive datasets and interdisciplinary research are necessary to reveal the relationship between microbes and their nutrient preferences.\\

Despite these challenges, AI technology provides a promising approach to studying microbial nutrient preferences. Its ability to accelerate research, improve accuracy, and reduce research costs has the potential to revolutionize the field of microbiology. Moreover, by optimizing AI algorithms and promoting interdisciplinary communication and cooperation, we can continue to advance our understanding of microbial nutrient preferences and develop more effective microbial culture protocols.\\

In conclusion, AI technology offers tremendous potential for advancing our understanding of microbial nutrient preferences. Although there are still limitations to overcome, we believe that with further development and interdisciplinary collaboration, AI technology will play an increasingly significant role in the field of microbiology.


\section{Work Steps}

1.	Collect data related to microbial nutrient preferences and genomic data to construct a dataset. (Already down)\\

2.	Use computer programs for genomic data processing, including steps such as removing redundant information and sequence comparison, to generate genomics datasets. (Important part one)\\

3.	Data mining using AI techniques, including methods such as machine learning and deep learning, is used to discover potential microbial nutrient preference patterns and patterns from the genomics dataset. (Important part two)\\

4.	Analyse and validate the predictive accuracy and reliability of AI models, which can be done using methods such as cross-validation and test set validation.\\

5.	Predict the nutrient preferences of microorganisms using AI models, and verify and validate them through experiments. (Important part three)\\

6.	Combined with the experimental results, the model algorithm and model structure are optimised to further improve the prediction accuracy and reliability. (Important part four)\\

7.	The optimised model was applied to the design of microbial culture protocols to provide more accurate and reliable microbial culture guidance for experimenters.(Give suggestion but not include in this project)\\

8.	In the practical application, the explanatory and interpretable results of the AI model predictions are analysed and evaluated, and the model is continuously refined and improved. (Give suggestion but not include in this project)
